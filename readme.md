# Data Processing 

Takes datasets in .csv files generated by Autoprop and formats the data. 

## bash
I make copies of each .csv file and store in the /full/csv directory.
I then run the C++ program, as described below, and save the output into a the /dialer directory.

## C++
Columns are specified for removal and some headings are changed.

We look for records where the name of the registered owner matches a phone record. 
Where an owner has multiple phone records, make a new record each unique phone record.

Transformed dataset is printed to standard output.
